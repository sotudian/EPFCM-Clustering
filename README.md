# Interval Type-2 Enhanced Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
Both FCM and PCM clustering methods have been widely applied to pattern recognition and data clustering.
Nevertheless, FCM is sensitive to noise and PCM occasionally generates coincident clusters. PFCM is an extension
of the PCM model by combining FCM and PCM, but this method still suffers from the weaknesses of PCM and FCM.
In the current paper, the weaknesses of the PFCM algorithm are corrected and the enhanced possibilistic fuzzy c-means (EPFCM) clustering algorithm is presented. EPFCM can still be sensitive to noise. Therefore, we propose an
interval type-2 enhanced possibilistic fuzzy c-means (IT2EPFCM) clustering method by utilizing two fuzzifiers

This repository contains Matlab implementations of the algorithms described in "Interval Type-2 Enhanced Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means clustering for Gene Expression Data Analysis."
